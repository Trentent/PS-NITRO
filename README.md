# PS-NITRO
PowerShell Module for NITRO (REST API) communication with Citrix NetScaler (Automation DevOps)

I have uploaded the latest version of my PowerShell Module code and the sample scripts used in the Citrix Summit presentation.

Have fun with the code and feel free to send me any feedback and improvements for the code to help me improve my PowerShell code and GitHub skills!

Cheers,
Esther

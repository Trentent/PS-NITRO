# PS-NITRO
PowerShell Module for NITRO (REST API) communication with Citrix NetScaler (Automation DevOps)

Unfortunately I have not been able to start my devops machine and upload the latest version of the code, including the samples shown during the Citrix Synergy presentation. So for now I could only upload an early version of the extended PowerShell Module.

Hopefully I'll be able to upload the latest version and sample scripts from the presentation by the end of the month (June).

Please feel free to contact me and ask for any clearifications of the code.

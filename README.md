# PS-NITRO
PowerShell Module for NITRO (REST API) communication with Citrix NetScaler (Automation DevOps)

I have uploaded the latest version of my PowerShell Module code and the sample scripts used in the Citrix Synergy presentation. So YES I have my dev machine hooked on the internet again :-)

As I am still learning PowerShell every day I will work on creating new PowerShell module (learning all about manifest files now) that will use separate script files for the different NetScaler features. This will allow me to more easily work on separate parts of the code and cmdlets and really dig into the NetScaler NITRO configurations.

So have fun with the code and I'm looking forward to any feedback and improvements for the code!

Cheers,
Esther

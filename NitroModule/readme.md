# NITRO Module

This is my first go at creating a more modular PowerShell Module that can be updated more easily as it is following the PowerShell standards and using GitHub as it is intended.

## Getting started

To start using the Module, simply use the Import-Module cmdlet and point to the root folder of your local copy of this NITRO Module directory

## What the import looks like

Next, what I'd suggest is adding your module to a directory in your $PSModulePath. This allows you to just type in `Import-Module NitroModule` and it'll work.
